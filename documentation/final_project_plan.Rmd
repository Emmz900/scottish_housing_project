# Context

## Business intelligence and data-driven decision making

*What insights can the business/organisation gain from your analysis and how will your analysis help the business/organisation make better decisions?*

This analysis will help the Scottish Government understand the factors which influence community belonging and neighbourhood ratings. This will help identify groups and areas with a low sense of community, or lower neighbourhood ratings which could be targeted with schemes to improve this.

## Domain knowledge and the business context

*Briefly describe the business/organisation and where your analysis fits within its aims/activity.*

The Scottish Household Survey is completed annually on behalf of the Scottish Government. The results are used by the Scottish Government to measure progress towards the National Performance Framework (NPF). It is also used by local authorities, and to influence policy areas such as housing, fuel poverty, and climate change.

# Data

## Internal and external data sources

*Briefly describe your data sources and which were internal (provided by the organisation) and external (not sourced from the organisation's data)*

**Internal Data Sources**

* Scottish Government - Statistics & Research, this is on the Scottish Government website and provides datasets for the official statistics of Scotland

**External Data Sources**

* UK Data Service, this is a secure data source requiring an academic login to access data for teaching, learning, and public benefit
* Public Health Scotland, their open data platform releases data under the Open Government Licence
* Spatial Hub, this is the source for Scottish local government spatial data

## Types of data

*What kind of data did you work with? E.g. categorical and numerical data and their sub-types.*


## Data formats

*What format did your data come in? E.g. all downloaded flat files (CSV) or any data from APIs, scraping etc.*

## Data quality and bias

*Briefly describe the quality of the data and whether you have any reasons to suggest the data is biased e.g. only data from a specific demographic even though a broader demographic would be of interest to the organisation.*

# Ethics

## Ethical issues in data sourcing and extraction

*Do you have any ethical concerns regarding the sourcing and extraction of your data?* 

Since the results come from a random selection of the general population they may not be entirely representative. People that are not in private accommodation (eg. prisons, hospitals, student accommodation) will not be represented. Neither will those who refused to participate in the survey. This could lead to some bias in the results.

Since the data collected in the survey contains sensitive information, the data publicly available is highly aggregated. This limits the analysis which can be done, but ensures there is no risk of sensitive information of being shared within this report.

## Ethical implications of business requirements

*Are there any ethical implications of the business requirements?*

# Analysis

## Stages in the data analysis process

*What were the main stages in your data analysis process?*

## Tools for data analysis

*What were the main tools you used for your analysis?*

## Descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive analysis

_Please report under which of the below categories your analysis falls **and why** (can be more than one)_ 

::: {.emphasis}
**Descriptive Analytics** tells you what happened in the past.

**Diagnostic Analytics** helps you understand why something happened in the past.

**Predictive Analytics** predicts what is most likely to happen in the future.

**Prescriptive Analytics** recommends actions you can take to affect those outcomes.
