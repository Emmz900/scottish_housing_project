# Context

## Business intelligence and data-driven decision making


This analysis will help the Scottish Government understand the factors which influence feelings of community belonging and neighbourhood ratings. This will help identify groups and areas with a low sense of community, or lower neighbourhood ratings which could be targeted with schemes to improve these aspects.

## Domain knowledge and the business context

The Scottish Household Survey is completed annually on behalf of the Scottish Government. The results are used by the Scottish Government to measure progress towards the National Performance Framework (NPF). It is also used by local authorities, and to influence policy areas such as housing, fuel poverty, and climate change.

# Data

## Internal and external data sources

**Internal Data Sources**

* Scottish Government - Statistics & Research, this is on the Scottish Government website and provides datasets for the official statistics of Scotland

**External Data Sources**

* UK Data Service, this is a secure data source requiring an academic login to access data for teaching, learning, and public benefit
* Public Health Scotland, their open data platform releases data under the Open Government Licence
* Spatial Hub, this is the source for Scottish local government spatial data

## Types of data

* **Categorical**  

  + **Nominal**  
  + Rural or urban   
  + Council area  
  + Tenure  
  + Housing Type  
  + Gender  

  + **Ordinal**  
  + Community Belonging and Neighbourhood Ratings were character strings which had an implied order of worst to best.  
  + Access to greenspace had several categories with a given order of closest to furthest.  

* **Numerical**  

  + **Discrete** 
  + The percentage of responses were discrete whole numbers between 0 and 100.  
  + SIMD could be considered discrete numerical (1-5) or ordinal.  
  + Ages could be considered continuous or discrete. They were given as whole numbers.  

  + **Continuous**  
  + None  

## Data formats

The data was mainly excel or csv, with some spatial tab data.

* community_belonging.csv  
  Rows: 43611 Columns: 13

* neighbourhood_rating.csv  
  Rows: 38055 Columns: 13
  
* council_area_codes.csv  
  Rows: 44 Columns: 14
  
* shs2019_social_public.tab  
  Rows: 10,528 Columns: 2,495

## Data quality and bias

There will be some bias in the data as only those in private households were surveyed, this excludes student accommodation and hospitals for example.

Some people may refuse to do the survey, if this tends to be people from a particular group or demographic they will also be under represented in the results.

# Ethics

## Ethical issues in data sourcing and extraction

The aggregated data that is publicly available has no personal identifying information and I therefore have no ethical concerns.

The dataset with the complete responses from 2019 may contain enough information to identify individuals and is therefore protected. Significant cleaning was completed to remove most of the collected information and focus only on the responses relevant to this analysis. The raw data has been excluded from the published repository to ensure privacy.

## Ethical implications of business requirements


It is important to remember that correlation does not mean causation, and care should be taken when making assumptions about the results of the analysis. Communities and neighbourhoods are complex and there are many factors not explored here which will be significant for local people.

# Analysis

## Stages in the data analysis process

1. Initial exploration of the available data and business questions
2. [Cleaning the data
3. Visualisation of the data] x many cycles
4. Creation of an R Shiny app to delve deeper in exploring patterns
5. Spatial visualisations of council areas
6. Statistical analysis of patterns found where relevant
7. Summarising answers to business questions

## Tools for data analysis

* R Studio  
  + R version 4.2.2  
  + R Shiny  

* Microsoft Powerpoint for final presentation of analysis

## Descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive analysis

This project was mainly descriptive analytics exploring how people have rated their neighbourhoods and communities in the past, how this has changed over time, and how it differs by area and demographic.
There is also some diagnostic analytics to try and understand why certain areas rated their neighbourhoods and communities in the way that they did.
