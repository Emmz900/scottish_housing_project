# Scottish Household Survey Data Project

## Background
This was an individual research project completed over 11 days for my final CodeClan project. The results were presented at our graduation ceremony supported by CodeBase and ClearScore.

The project explores the factors impacting neighbourhood ratings and community belonging in Scotland using data from the Scottish Household Survey. The Scottish Household Survey is an annual, cross-sectional survey of a random selection of people in private residences across Scotland.

An R Shiny app was created to aid exploration of the data, this can be found ![here](https://emma-menzies.shinyapps.io/scottish_household_survey_exploration/).

## Key terms

* **Community Belonging** is based on the question: "How strongly do you feel you belong to your immediate neighbourhood?"
* **Neighbourhood Rating** is based on the question: "Thinking now about the nieghbourhood you live in, how would you rate it as a place to live? *Define 'your neighbourhood' as: 'the street you live in and the streets nearby' (urban) or 'the local area' (rural).*"
* **Social Rented** = (managed by public authorities and housing associations with support from the Scottish Government) ![](https://www.gov.scot/policies/social-housing/)
* **SIMD** = Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation

## Findings
The presentation of findings can be found within the presentation folder of this repository. A report of the findings is in progress within the documentation folder. The full analysis can be found within the analysis_scripts_and_functions folder.

### Summary of findings
Feelings of community belonging are fairly high in Scotland with 80% of people rating it "Fairly" or "Very" strongly.

Neighbourhood ratings are even higher with almost 60% of people rating their local neighbourhood "Very good", and only 5% rating their neighbourhood "Fairly" or "Very" poor.
